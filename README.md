# Welcome! 👋
I create this project to learn more about FFMPEG
in Nodejs.

- You can see some drops of sweat here:

Inspect index.js to see hard-code 🧐

### Getting started
Install the dependencies:
```
npm i || yarn
```
and then run:
```
npm run start || yarn start
```

Listening in port 3000!
Happy coding 💻

PS: I wrote this project in 1 hour, so don't notice the dirty code, 
I just wanted to explore the library in the time I had, 
I'll be back soon to improve more.
